"""
Strip outputs from IPython Notebooks.

nbstripout opens a notebook, strips its output, and writes the outputless
version to the original file.  Useful mainly as a git pre-commit hook for users
who don't want to track output in VCS.  This does mostly the same thing as the
`Clear All Output` command in the notebook UI.
